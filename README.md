# Coffee-Machine-Simulator

This is a coffe machine simualtor. The idea is that there a some options for a customer to drink from and some stock on the machine to make those drinks.

The functionality I added is that the machine checks for inputs like the drink the person wants, also the money they inserted to. Also there are some secret functions like the turn off option or the stock function.

This is a practice from my learning process.
